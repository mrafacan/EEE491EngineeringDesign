In today's digital age, ensuring the confidentiality and security of our communication is paramount. However, achieving this security often comes with a hefty price tag, rendering it inaccessible to many. Recognizing the need for a cost-effective yet robust solution, we introduce a system designed to democratize secure messaging using the efficient ElGamal encryption method.

The primary goal of this project is to establish a secure communication framework accessible to everyone. By leveraging ElGamal encryption, renowned for its effectiveness and affordability, we aim to break barriers and provide a platform for confidential text-based interactions without imposing significant financial burdens.

The system operates through a simplified yet potent mechanism involving two development boards. One board is tasked with encrypting the data, ensuring its confidentiality, while the other board handles decryption, allowing secure retrieval of the original message. This approach not only ensures affordability but also simplicity in its execution, making secure communication an achievable reality for individuals across diverse backgrounds.

Through this cost-efficient strategy, our system endeavors to facilitate secure message exchanges without compromising on the strength of encryption. By employing readily available development boards, we strive to make secure communication an integral part of everyday interactions, fostering a safer and more inclusive digital environment.

In essence, this project aims to redefine secure communication by bridging the gap between affordability and robust encryption. By democratizing access to secure messaging, we envision a future where individuals can interact confidently, knowing their conversations remain private and protected.

	\subsubsection{Activity Diagram}
 	The general UML diagram of our software is shown in the figure and it shows that. First, a public key is generated on the decryption card for encryption and this key is sent to the encryption card. Then, on the encryption card, the user's message is converted into a numeric value and encrypted with the public key of the decryption card and the encrypted message is sent to the decryption card. The encrypted message is decrypted with the decryption card's own private key and the original message is obtained on the decryption card.
