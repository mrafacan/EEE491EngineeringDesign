		With the goal of bridging the gap between robust security and affordability, this project introduces an innovative system that uses ElGamal encryption to make available confidential messaging in response to the growing demand for accessible secure communication. This system allows individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in secure text-based interactions. After developing the encryption algorithm and identifying particular hardware components—such as STM32 microcontrollers, a Wi-Fi module for data transmission, and USB interfaces for connectivity—the project has reached important milestones. The system runs on two STM32 development boards, one for encryption and the other for decryption, providing an efficient and streamlined method.The ultimate goal is to redefine secure messaging, guaranteeing that people can interact with confidence while protecting the confidentiality of their conversations. This initiative looks to make secure communication a daily reality by utilizing these widely compatible and easily accessible hardware components.

	\section{Introduction}
In our era, ensuring the confidentiality and security of our communication is important. However, achieving this security often comes with a unaffordable price tag, makes it inaccessible to many. Recognizing the need for a cost-effective yet robust solution, we introduce a system designed to make secure messaging accessible to everyone using the efficient ElGamal encryption method.

This project's main objective is to create a safe communication environment that is open to all. We do this by utilizing ElGamal encryption, which is widely known for its efficiency and low cost. We hope to remove obstacles and offer a platform for private text messages without putting a heavy financial strain on users.

Two development boards function as the system's basic yet efficient mechanism: one board encrypts the data, guaranteeing its privacy, and the other board decrypts it, enabling safe delivery of the initial message. This method guarantees both affordability and ease of use, enabling secure communication to be a reality for people from a variety of backgrounds.

By utilizing these affordable development boards, we hope to increase the security of messages sent and received while maintaining the integrity of the encryption. In this way, we hope to integrate secure communication into daily interactions and promote a more inclusive and safe online community.

At its core, our project seeks to reimagine secure communication by filling the gap that exists between effective encryption and affordability. We foresee a future in which people can engage with confidence, knowing that their messages are private and secure, because secure messaging will become more widely accessible.

	\section{Needs Identification}

For text-based encryption, there is a need to create a system that enables secure messaging for everyone. Utilizing the cost-effective ElGamal encryption method, this system aims to provide accessible and secure communication for individuals seeking confidential text-based interaction without incurring significant expenses. The system operates through two development boards, where one board encrypts the data and sends it to the other board, responsible for decryption. This cost-efficient approach ensures that anyone can securely exchange messages, fostering a safer digital environment for communication.

	\subsubsection{Activity Diagram}
	
 The general activity diagram of our project is shown in the Figure 3 and it shows that. First, a public key is generated on the decryption card for encryption and this key is sent to the encryption card. Meanwhile user can enter a message to the user interface and send it to the encryption card. Then, on the encryption card, the user's message is converted into a numeric value and encrypted with the public key of the receiver card and the encrypted message is sent to the decryption card. on the decryption card, the encrypted message is decrypted with the decryption card's own private key and the original message is obtained. Finally decryption card sends message to the user interface and user can display the message.

 		\section{Conclusions}
	
	Firstly, it is crucial to emphasize the purpose and requirements of the project. We plan to use two development boards to implement ElGamal encryption. One of these boards will perform the encryption process, while the other will decrypt the cipher. The user's input text will be encrypted for secure transmission. The primary objectives of our project include being cost-effective, appealing to a wide audience, and ensuring accessibility.\cite{koblitz2012course}

	
	Our proposed solution will employ the secure encryption algorithm ElGamal to ensure the security of communication. This differentiates our solution from other available alternatives because ElGamal is generally acknowledged as a reliable and effective encryption method\cite{mollin2001introduction}. Additionally, we offer a hardware-based solution using two different development boards, which can be considered an innovative approach to the project.
	
	ElGamal encryption stands out for its effectiveness and reliability, and the project's cost-effective solution is accessible to a wide range of users, according to the evaluations done. The hardware-based solution might provide more dependable and faster performance.
	
Cost-effectiveness is another important component that contributes to the project's attractiveness. Through the use of open-source technology and widely accessible development boards, the project manages expenses while maintaining a high standard of encryption service. This strategy fosters adoption and deployment in a variety of situations, from individual users concerned with privacy to small enterprises seeking for cost-effective security solutions, in addition to making the project financially accessible to a wide range of users.
	
In conclusion, there are a number of noteworthy benefits to our proposed solution, including its dependability, affordability, and appeal to a wide range of users. The use of the ElGamal encryption algorithm is seen as an effective method for ensuring communication security	\cite{van1999fundamentals}. Overall, the project shows promise as a general-purpose solution, and our hardware-based approach offers a unique benefit.
