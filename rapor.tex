	\section{Introduction}
Encryption is crucial in the digital world because it ensures that sensitive information remains secure and private. It involves encoding data in a way that only authorized parties can access and understand it. Without encryption, data such as personal information, financial details, passwords, and communications would be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, or manipulation by cybercriminals or malicious entities.

In today's landscape, encryption remains crucial as our reliance on digital communication and data sharing continues to grow. With the proliferation of smart devices, cloud storage, online transactions, and remote work, the volume of sensitive information transmitted over networks has increased significantly.

Moreover, as privacy concerns gain prominence, individuals seek assurance that their personal data, conversations, and transactions remain confidential. Encryption serves as a vital tool in protecting this information, especially in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated hacking techniques.

Overall, in today's digital era marked by increased connectivity and data sharing, encryption stands as an essential mechanism for safeguarding sensitive information, preserving privacy, and fortifying cybersecurity measures against evolving threats.

Additionally, in the realm of modern cryptography, various encryption methods are employed to ensure secure communication and data protection. These include well-established techniques like RSA and AES, along with innovative approaches such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for resource-constrained environments and Homomorphic Encryption for secure computation on encrypted data. ElGamal encryption, noted for its secure key exchange abilities, stands among these methods as a key player in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information in our increasingly digital world.

	\section{Problem statement/Needs Identification}
	In today's interconnected digital world, secure communication stands as a fundamental necessity to safeguard sensitive information. However, ensuring data privacy during transmission across networks remains a significant challenge. The ElGamal encryption system, known for its robust security features based on the difficulty of discrete logarithm problem, presents an opportunity to establish secure communication channels.
		
	The primary objective involves designing an ElGamal-based system that enables the exchange of encrypted messages between two development board over an insecure communication channel. This system aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the transmitted data. The project will delve into the intricacies of ElGamal's encryption and decryption processes within the context of development board communication.

	\subsubsection{UML Design}
 	The general UML diagram of our software is shown in the figure and it shows that. First, a public key is generated on the decryption card for encryption and this key is sent to the encryption card. Then, on the encryption card, the user's message is converted into a numeric value and encrypted with the public key of the decryption card and the encrypted message is sent to the decryption card. The encrypted message is decrypted with the decryption card's own private key and the original message is obtained on the decryption card.
